## Project Summary

In this project, I analyzed food wastage patterns at GraceyBee‚Äôs Restaurant, using a real-world dataset downloaded from Kaggle and visualized with Microsoft Power BI.

The goal was to uncover the root causes of food waste and propose actionable strategies, reduce waste, cut costs, and improve sustainability.

## Data Cleaning

Before building the dashboards, I:
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset in Microsoft Excel.
- Removed inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.
- Categorized fields by food type, event type, guest count, pricing tier, and more.
- Imported the clean data into Power BI for dynamic visualization and slicing.

## Key Business Questions

> 1. What types of food contribute most to wastage?
> 2. Which preparation methods generate the highest waste?
> 3. How do events, seasons, and pricing affect food waste?
> 4. What actionable strategies can help reduce food waste?
